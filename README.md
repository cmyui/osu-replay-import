## Hello!

This program is quite simple. If you're running Windows, then you can simply drag a of replays (not yet recursive, although you *can* drag multiple folders in) into import.py, and your replays should begin importing.

If you're running linux, the same concept is applied; sys.argv[1:] is passed, so link as many folders as you'd like. You'll also need to enter the path to your osu! exe when it asks (must be absolute path).

Enjoy, I guess.
